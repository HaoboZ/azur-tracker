# Azur Lane Tracker

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [localhost](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## TODO

* mobile ship page
* have ship dialog load better
* change react-sortablejs to react-dnd or react-sortable-hoc (animated?)
