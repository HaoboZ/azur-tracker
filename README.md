# Azur Lane Tracker

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
```

Open [localhost](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## TODO

* next-auth use getServerSession when fully released
* next-pwa remove buildExcludes when fixed
* eslint change to next after version 8 support

* make enhancedDisplay take more options for width
